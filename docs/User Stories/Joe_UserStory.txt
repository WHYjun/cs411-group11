I was a runner in high school and I've been meaning to start running again as a way to keep fit but I don't know where I should run. Using the app has helped take out trying to find an exact trail through the city considering I can just put in how long I want to run and it'll plot a course for me starting from where I live. It'll also give me a playlist that ramps up in intensity as I run so running never gets boring.
