As an frequent advanced runner who runs a handful of miles a day, running can get very boring for me. Having a web app that allows me to get a new, interesting, but safe route to run every day is such a massive boost to my day. It really gets rid of the “administrative” part of running like planning a route, picking my music, making sure the music playlist I have is long enough, pairing my fitbit to my phone, et cetera. An app like this would streamline all of that and allow me to focus on the part that I love: running!
