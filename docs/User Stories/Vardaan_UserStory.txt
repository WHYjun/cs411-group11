As a cardio enthusiast who doesn't have time during the day to run, I want to run at night. The problem with that is I don't live in the best of neighborhoods and don't feel safe going outside my house at night. I want a service that will make me feel more comfortable to go outside my house and fulfill my cardio needs. I want an app that I can log into and ask it for the safest route to run around any area that I search for. "Safe" to me means a route that avoids high crime and accident rate areas. I want to be able to determine the boundary of the route, maybe even customize it, and then I want to have it sent to my phone so that I can access it while I'm on the run.
