As a brand new, struggling runner, I always need some musics which make running feel easier. I am easily exhausted, so I need some breaks during running. Therefore, I need an app to provide running music playlist which contains both fast-bpm musics and slow-bpm musics to help me run longer with break. Also, this  app can be used for interval training if I am used to run.  This app automatically sync my spotify, fitbit, and facebook to personalize my playlist and running time.
