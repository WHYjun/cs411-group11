User Case 1:
This week, as a wedding gift my husband and I received tickets to Athens, Greece! With Travel Tube, I can spend less time researching what I should be doing and visiting, and more time being excited about visiting. I can easily search specific places I already knew about, and have the option to see events going on in the area plus videos about tourism really makes me confident that I will get the most out of the city whilst I’m there.


User Case 2:
I just graduated college and as a reward before I start working I wanted to travel to parts of the world I've never been to. It’s easy to plan for somewhere specific, but not knowing where I want to go makes it nearly impossible! With Travel Tube, I can roam across the world virtually, finding places I never would have thought of and seeing what interesting events those places are hosting!


User Case 3:
During a long layover flight back to the US from Croatia, my plane got massively delayed in Geneva, Switzerland and the next available flight was two days later. Normally, I would just hang out in the hotel room provided to me until my flight. With this app, I can quickly find fun and interesting things to do in a city I have never visited. It gives me the confidence to visit cities as if I was a local!


User Case 4:
My girlfriend and I recently visited Kyoto in Japan. We had given ourselves 5 days in the city, but after only 2 days had done everything we had planned! We really didn’t know what else to do, and normally would just walk around aimlessly in the city. With Travel Tube we were able to find super interesting activities to do and awesome places to visit with little to no work! We attended a concert that we found on the app that we would have never known about without it!
