## App Summary

Traveling. Something we all yearn for, yet something we all do so wrong when we finally have the opportunity to do so! A great traveling experience should be defined by three pillars: spontaneity, relaxation, and fun.

Instead though, traveling has turned into a painstakingly long preparation process that only sucks the joy out of something we love so much. You have to pick where to go, which alone can be a headache! Once that has been done, figuring exactly what you're going to be doing every minute of every day to maximize your time in this new city is like putting all the pieces together to an impossible puzzle. Who wants to be doing that? And a travel agent you say? Why pay hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to someone to do a job you can easily do? Once you finally get to your destination, everything is so planned you feel more like a robot than someone enjoying a new city. 

Fear not! Enter Travel-Tube, the one stop shop for all your travel preparation needs. We specialize in end to end travel preparation. Looking for somewhere new to go? We have you covered. Already know where you're going but want to find fun ways to experience the city? Done. Stuck in a city for a layover? We'll make that layover the best you've ever had.

Travel-Tube allows users to utilize a very familiar Google Map to drag and drop their way around the world. After having dropped the pin in a location they are considering, or are visiting, our app will pull up videos of the amazing, fun, and famous activities both locals and tourists enjoy. Drop a pin on Paris and the guide videos will tell you to visit the Pantheon, the Eiffel Tower, l'Entrecote de Paris, and many more popular destinations. We are the world's first virtual tour guide to the world!

On top of recommending the best places to visit while you're there, Travel-Tube will also give you up to date event calendars through Eventbrite. Have a free night in a new city? Check our app and you'll get a list of great events like concerts and sporting matches to attend!

Preparing for a long vacation has always been the process that most dread, and Travel-Tube is determined to Make Travel Great Again. No longer do you need to fret about things to do, places to visit, and how to affectively spend your time. Instead you can just drag, drop, and go!
